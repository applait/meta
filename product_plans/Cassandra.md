## Idea

A *software defect prediction system* that can read software source code and tell what issues can result from the current piece of source code.

It is an Artificial Narrow Intelligence system that can learn from existing version-controlled source codes and the issues filed against the source codes, and can potentially identify the changes in the source code that result in certain types of issues.
