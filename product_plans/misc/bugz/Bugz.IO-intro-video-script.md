## Set the stage (20 sec)

If you are trying to track issues of a product, or planning for product development, very few paid solutions cut close to Bugzilla in terms of features and stability.

Bugzilla was originally built for Mozilla. But since it was made public over 15 years ago, Bugzilla has received wide-spread adoption, among open-source projects and businesses.

## Problem statement (25 sec)

This means there is a large number of people out there (including the guys behind this video) who use Bugzilla daily and spend over 20 minutes of their working days dealing with Bugzilla.

If you ask these people what they *don't* like about Bugzilla, the answer is almost always, "That user interface." (Some have been heard complaining, "Why not use a pen and sticky notes? That has a better UI!")

Well, the bad news is, Bugzilla will probably remain like what it is, because it was not made to cope with the UI expectations of today's users. But, below that layer of not-so-good-looks lies a core of solid engineering.

The good news is, we have planned to give some good looks to the age old Bugzilla.

## Introduce the makers (5 sec)

We are Applait, and this is Bugz.

## Punchline (10 sec)

We have conceptualized Bugz with one simple thing in mind: How Bugzilla would have been if it was built in 2015.
