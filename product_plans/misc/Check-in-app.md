# Idea

- An application which allows people to record their travel history, i.e., it allows them to checkin to places they have been to.
- Application will be built for Android, iOS and Firefox OS.
- This application will provide realtime infographics of places visited, giving people a way to visualize and share their travel history.
- The system will be gamified in a way that will encourage people to participate even more and use the application on a daily basis.
- It will have a subscriber model through which people can follow others' activities.
- This application will be an alternate global database of places, people and user behaviour that can be visualized in realtime.
- Users will have the option to import their data from Foursquare, giving the app an immediate headstart to populate infographics. 
- Possible integrations with location-aware fitness devices in future for data input. (e.g. [UP](https://jawbone.com/up/developer), [FitBit](http://dev.fitbit.com/))

# Assumptions

- People want to share their location data
- People want to use a new platform to share their location data
- People are interested in seeing their travel history
- People are comfortable sharing their travel history
- People would prefer activity-driven challenges over simple badge-based goals
- Enough people will use this application on a daily basis to interest advertisers.
- Advertisers would be interested in getting their ads served to targeted users on this platform.
- We have a clean bridge between a non-controversial data policy and owning the user data.
- The data will be rich enough to attract future buyers for acquisitions.

# Pain it solves

- Currently neither Foursquare nor Swarm visualizes user data. They only show latest feeds of users. But, there is no way for a user to have a map or a visualization of their timeline.
- This means, the entire travel history is essentially ~~undiscoverable~~ underdiscoverable.
- Foursquare is a service to discover places near you and Swarm is an app through which you can checkin to those places. This causes a friction in experience between discovery and logging. Swarm also adds messaging and badges through which you can find friends to do things together.
- But none of them focus on making your travel history beautiful.

# Competition

- Foursquare - Global database of places (10M+ users and 430K+ ratings on Android)
- Swarm - The checkin app from Foursquare (5M+ users and 230K+ ratings on Android)
- [Moves](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protogeo.moves) - Visualizes travel history, by tracking your travel. But it does not give you the option to have a place-based visualization. (500K+ users and 25K+ ratings on Android)

# Revenue model

- Targeted ads based on check-in. Publishers will be able to promote themselves through targeted checkins. e.g. when someone checks in at a cafe that serves salads, we can promote a nearby juice joint that is currently offering discounts for the holiday season.
- Licensing out anonymous behaviour data. [Long term]

# Risks

- User data is a sensitive topic. We need to avoid pitfalls in our privacy policy, data collection and data selling policies.
- Advertisements can cause trouble depending on how we give out user information. [Foursquare tried that and failed](http://valleywag.gawker.com/here-is-how-foursquare-plans-on-turning-your-life-into-484404419) because they were snooping in too much.
- [Avoid Foursq's mistakes](http://readwrite.com/2013/04/22/5-reasons-foursquare-lost-the-social-local-mobile-revolution), particularly the one about gamification.

# Challenges

- Identifying the right infographics that would help us present the information in a concise manner.
- Wooing users away from Swarm.
- Reaching out to advertisers.
- Engaging UX
