## Brief description of idea/product/service (< 50 words)

**Describe the problem you are targeting**

ConQ's aim is to provide a threaded, real-time, contextual audio/video/textual discussion, which can be annotated, archived and revisited later. It'll allow participants to ask, up/downvote questions, that can be moderated, without interrupting the speaker â€“ across form factors, using web as the platform. 

ConQ is a selective mashup between Skype, Hangouts, Discourse & StackExchange; made entirely with web-technology that works across platforms.

## Business model and any revenues till date?

Phase 1:

-  It will start as a freemium hosted service, where anyone can log in and start a video call.
- Users can use the service for free, but pay for premium features, e.g. more than certain amount of people per conference, annotated conference archiving, web service integrations etc.

Phase 2:

- Allow private hosted deployments and on-premise deployments for companies.
- Pricing will be be based on number of licenses.

We haven't figured out the exact numbers yet, in terms of pricing. Things will be clearer once we hit alpha.

## What do you need from us?

**If you are raising capital, how much are you raising and what will it be used for?**

We are looking at a 50K USD angel investment, which will be used over 09 months for:

- Sustaining a team of 4 full-time and 4 part time people
- Covering IT and infra costs of the product, including code-hosting, servers.
- Procuring devices for development/testing.
