## Unified Communications Over Real-time Networks
# Case Study: Grouphone

Grouphone is a group call service, focused entirely on providing a distraction-free audio conferencing experience on the web and smartphones.

It uses WebRTC, and is optimized to make real-time communications possible with minimal resource usage, even over high-latency networks. Being a web-based solution, all it needs is a standard compliant web-browser; and appeals to users across devices, form-factors and operating systems.

The platform that powers Grouphone, however, isn't limited to handling audio-only communications. It's a highly distributed and efficient technology that can interconnect a large spectrum of real-time networks. Flip over to know more about it.
