## Applait’s value-based pricing strategy for consultancy

This document lays the groundwork of the pricing strategy of Applait for consultancy. It derives the idea of value-based pricing from multiple sources and tries to map that to the services and products that Applait will offer to customers who hire us for consultancy.

## Target platforms

### Smartphones

- Firefox OS
- Android
- iOS

### Web

 - Developing APIs/Backends for technologies related to mobility.

## Target customer demography

Our consultancy division will cater to *businesses*. The target demography can be broken down to these main segments:

 - **Entrepreneurs** - Who want to invest in a new product idea on web technologies or smartphone platforms and need an app developed for it.
 - **Enterprises** - Already established companies who need an application to be developed on web or smartphone platforms (inclusive of porting an application from other platforms).
 - **OEMs** - Device manufacturers who need Firefox OS applications to be developed, which will be shipped with the devices.

## About value-based pricing

### Why use value-based pricing?

This pricing model is determined based on the value customers are willing to pay for the services we offer. So, value-based pricing is determined by the value our customers perceive of the services we provide to them.

Value-based pricing, if played well, can pull in more profit for a business, than cost-plus pricing. Cost-plus pricing is the traditional method of pricing where the selling price is determined by adding a profit margin to the cost price. While cost-plus pricing works well with large volumes of transactions or in mass markets, value-based pricing works really good for niché markets, products sold on emotions (fashion etc.) or for indispensable add-ons.

The point to be noted here is: customers don’t care how much something cost you or your competitors to make the product/solution, they care how much value they’re receiving at a particular price.

### The value-based pricing challenge

Since we cater to businesses, we have to understand how our services benefit those businesses (our customers), i.e., how the services or products that we offer help those businesses to get larger profits and probably higher market share.

This method focuses on the customer. It needs as much data as possible to determine the amount a customer is willing to pay for our product. This means, for each of our contracts, there will be some research work needed to be done before we can ascertain the price. While this can get us customer confidence, because we try to understand their needs, it may potentially deter a prospective customer who is not willing to answer some of our questions. Also, since the price quoted in this model will be generally higher than cost-plus pricing, it may scare away customers who don’t see enough value in our product.

Any pricing model ultimately boils down to a numerical equation. A customer will always see the value through some unit of measurement. To get the confidence of our customers, they need to have a clear idea of the metrics that we use to determine the price. These metrics are the differentiating factors that make us unique from any other competition on the market.

It is not a straight-forward, set-it-once-and-forget game. Each of our customers will have a different setting, different requirement, different social norms and different expectations. Given this challenge, it needs careful attention each time to understand the actual value our customer perceives for the deal at hand. Avoid over-pricing at all cost. This may lead to customers feeling exploited and we may lose a good number of deals in the future.
